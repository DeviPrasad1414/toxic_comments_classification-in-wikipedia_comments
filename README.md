This project is a ML classification project of the different comments on wikipedia.
In this project we used various types of libraries for text classification and rating those text or comment according to the toxic level.
We taking a large number of Wikipedia comments dataset which is named as jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge which have been labeled by human raters for toxic behaviour.We made classification of the types of toxicity of the comments as below.
Toxic, Severe_toxic, Obscence,threat, insult, identity_hate.
When we coming to import the modules we have used pandas and numpy for the tabuler data processing, matplotlib, seaborn and mainly nltk for NLP usage, from nltk we imported stopwords and SnowballStemmer.
we used the classifiers like LogisticRegression and MultinomialNb from Naive Bayes
Its more similar to the sentimental analysis but in sentimental analysis we get the output as the sentiment or the feeling wihch resembles the particular sentence.
But in this project the level of toxicity of the sentence which will more useful in the text classification and can aslo used in different social media application and for political issues.
